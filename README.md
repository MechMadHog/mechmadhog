### Hello, I'm Mike.

I have a **BA in Creative Digital Media**, as a result I am equiped with a background in

## 🎨 Design and 🖥️ Development along with a whole assortment of other ancillary areas.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on a couple of side projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building myself a little Gallery / Portfolio to display some of my artwork.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning out a resources page for: Tools / Equipment that I use on a regular basis.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An about section and a list of my accomplishments / certificates.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blog to document certain aspects of my life / describe some of my interests.  

* ⚡ Fun fact: I have dyspraxia; so it's almost like my thoughts are set to shuffle.
