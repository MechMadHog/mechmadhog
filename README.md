## Hey, I'm Mike MacDonagh - aka **Mechanical Mad Hog**

I build things that live where **design** meets **development**.  
Sometimes sleek. Sometimes experimental. Always functional.

By day, I’m a **Creative Digital Media graduate** turning ideas into interactive realities.  
By night, I’m training **Walter**... my offline AI sidekick and soon-to-be neuroprosthesis.  
Together, we’re testing the limits of what I can build with web tech, automation, and a little stubborn curiosity.  

**What I love making:**  
- 🎨 Interfaces that look good *and* feel good to use  
- 🖥️ Tools that actually make people’s lives easier  
- 🔧 Odd little experiments that somehow… work  

**Right now I’m:**  
- Teaching Walter to think without the cloud  
- Moving into the **FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development and APIs** certificate  
- Stockpiling a growing arsenal of weird and wonderful web projects

### 🔮 What’s Next

- Building **Walter’s Brain**: Obsidian + Docker + Neo4j + local LLMs = my offline cognitive prosthesis

⚡ **Fun fact**: I have **dyspraxia**, which means my thoughts often take the scenic route… perfect for finding the solutions no one else sees.  

Take a look around; you’ll find working prototypes, polished builds, and the occasional “happy accident.”
