### Hey, I'm Mike MacDonagh (a.k.a Mechanical Mad Hog)

I’m a **Creative Digital Media graduate** passionate about blending **design** and **technology**. I specialize in:

- 🎨 **Design**: Creative direction, visual design, and UI/UX.  
- 🖥️ **Development**: Full-stack web development, automation, and AI.  
- 🔧 **Innovation**: Exploring tools, coding techniques, and building unique personal projects.

🌱 I’m currently:  
- Training **Walter**, my offline personal LLM assistant  
- Completing the **FreeCodeCamp curriculum**  
- Building functional, creative web tools with everything I’ve learned

⚡ **Fun fact**: I have **dyspraxia**, so my thoughts often shuffle—like a creative brainstorm in overdrive.
