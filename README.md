### Hey, I'm Mike MacDonagh (a.k.a Mechanical Mad Hog).

I’m a **Creative Digital Media graduate** with a passion for blending **design** and **technology**. I specialize in:

- 🎨 **Design**: Creative direction, visual design, and UI/UX.
- 🖥️ **Development**: Full-stack web development, automation, and AI.
- 🔧 **Innovation**: Exploring new tools, coding techniques, and personal projects.
  
* 🌱 Currently working on multiple side projects, including AI (Training Walter my personal LLM project), Completing the FCC Curriculum, and building functional web tools with what I have learned.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I have **dyspraxia**, so my thoughts often shuffle—like a creative brainstorm in overdrive.

Check out my [personal website](https://mechmadhog.com/) where I share my work, ideas, and progress.
