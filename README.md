## Hey, I'm Mike MacDonagh - aka **Mechanical Mad Hog**

I build things that live where **design** meets **development**.  
Sometimes sleek. Sometimes experimental. Always functional.

By day, I’m a **Creative Digital Media graduate** turning ideas into interactive realities.  
By night, I’m training **Walter**… my offline AI sidekick and soon-to-be neuroprosthesis.  
Together, we’re testing the limits of what I can build with web tech, automation, and a little stubborn curiosity.  

**What I love making:**  
- 🎨 Interfaces that look good *and* feel good to use  
- 🖥️ Tools that actually make people’s lives easier  
- 🔧 Odd little experiments that somehow… work  

**Right now I’m:**  
- Teaching Walter to think without the cloud  
- Finishing my **Full-Stack Certificate** 
  (This requires completing a total of 8 certificates to earn
  it's like a mini degree - and tbh has been just as difficult to accomplish.)
- Stockpiling a growing arsenal of weird and wonderful web projects
- Building various sites for my portfolio

### 🔮 What’s Next
- Testing & Debugging (safe guarding my projects)  
- Building **Walter’s Brain**: Obsidian + Docker + Neo4j + local LLMs = my offline cognitive prosthesis  

---

### 🛠️ Tech I’m Playing With
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (custom themes, animations), JavaScript (DOM, regex, games)  
- **Frameworks**: Jekyll (static sites), CodePen (rapid demos), GitHub Pages (deployment)  
- **AI/Automation**: n8n, LM Studio, Docker, Anything-LLM  
- **Platforms**: Omarchy + Windows (dual-system workflow)  
- **New Priorities**:  
  - Switching fully over to **Linux**  
  - Getting comfortable with **Node.js**

⚡ **Fun fact**: I have **dyspraxia**, which means my thoughts often take the scenic route… perfect for finding the solutions no one else sees.

Take a look around; you’ll find working prototypes, polished builds, and the occasional “happy accident.”
