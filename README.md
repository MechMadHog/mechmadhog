## ⚙️😠🐗 Hey, I’m Mike MacDonagh - aka **Mechanical Mad Hog**

I build things where **design meets development**.  
Sometimes clean. Sometimes experimental. Always meant to *work*.

I’m drawn to systems that:
- are easy to reason about 🧠  
- don’t collapse under real use  
- trade novelty for durability

I’m a **Creative Digital Media** practitioner who enjoys turning rough ideas into things that actually function.

A lot of my spare time currently goes into **Walter** - an offline, local-first AI system I’m building to help me think, explore ideas, and stress-test workflows.

Most of what I do comes down to pushing tools until the cracks show, then figuring out how to make them stronger.

### 🧰 What I Like Building
- 🎨 Interfaces that look good *and* feel straightforward  
- 🖥️ Tools that remove unnecessary steps  
- 🔧 Small, slightly odd experiments that evolve into solid systems  

---

### 🎯 Current Focus
- Building **Walter** as a local-first, cloud-independent system  
- Completing a **Full-Stack certification pathway** (eight certificates total)  
- Revisiting and hardening existing projects through testing and edge-case analysis  
- Expanding my portfolio with systems that are **robust, inspectable, and maintainable**, including an offline stack using Obsidian, Docker, Neo4j, and local LLMs

### 🛠️ Tech I’m Working With
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (custom themes, animations), JavaScript (DOM, regex, small games)  
- **Frameworks**: Jekyll (static sites), CodePen (rapid demos), GitHub Pages (deployment)  
- **AI / Automation**: n8n, LM Studio, Docker, Anything-LLM  
- **Platforms**: Omarchy + Windows (dual-system workflow)  
- **Current Priorities**:  
  - Moving fully to **Linux** 🐧  
  - Becoming more comfortable with **Node.js**

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I have **dyspraxia**, which means my thinking tends to be non-linear - useful for spotting patterns, designing systems, and finding solutions that aren’t always obvious.

Have a look around.  
You’ll find working prototypes, hardened builds, and the occasional happy accident.
