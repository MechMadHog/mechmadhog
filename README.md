### Hello, I'm Mike.

I have a **BA in Creative Digital Media**, which means I have a background in

## 🎨 Design and 🖥️ Development along with an assortment of other ancillary areas.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on building a portfolio site to put onto my domain using:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**HTML & CSS**, **Bootstrap** and **Twig**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To display / sell my paintings.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A resources page for: Tools / Equipment that I use on a regular basis.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An about section and a list of my accomplishments / certificates.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blog to document certain aspects of my life / describe some of my interests.  

  

* ⚡ Fun fact: I have dyspraxia; so it's almost like my thoughts are set to shuffle.
* 😄 Pronouns: Him | Yer Man.
