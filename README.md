### Hello, my name is Michael.

I have a **BA in Creative Digital Media**, which means I have a background in

## 🎨 Design and 🖥️ Development along with an assortment of other ancillary areas.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on building a portfolio site to put onto my domain.
 1. To display / sell my paintings
 2. A resources page for: Tools / Equipment that I use on a regular basis.
 3. An about section and a list of my accomplishments / certificates.
 4. A blog to document certain aspects of my life / describe some of my interests.

  

* ⚡ Fun fact: I have dyspraxia; so it's almost like my thoughts are set to shuffle.
* 😄 Pronouns: Yer Man | Dat Fella.
