## ⚙️😠🐗 Hey, I’m Mike MacDonagh aka **Mechanical Mad Hog**

I build things because I need them to exist.  
Design and development are just the tools I use to make that happen.

Some of what I build is tidy.  
Some of it's rough.  
If it’s public, it works well enough to stand over.

I care about systems that make sense when you look at them and still make sense when something goes wrong.

I come from a **Creative Digital Media** background, but I’m more interested in whether something holds up than how clever it looks.

Most of my free time goes into **Walter**, an offline, local-first AI system I’m building for myself.  
It exists because I think better with tools than without them.

A lot of my work follows the same pattern:  
build it, push it, break it, then fix what actually mattered.

---

### 🧰 What I End Up Building
- Interfaces that are clear and usable  
- Tools that remove steps instead of adding them  
- Small ideas that turn into bigger systems over time  

I don’t chase novelty.  
If something lasts, I keep it.

---

### 🎯 Current Focus
- Building **Walter** as a local-first, cloud-independent system  
- Completing a **Full-Stack certification pathway**  
- Reworking older projects so they are simpler and stronger  
- Building systems that are understandable without explanation  

---

### 🛠️ Tech I’m Using
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks**: Jekyll, CodePen, GitHub Pages  
- **AI / Automation**: n8n, LM Studio, Docker, Anything-LLM  
- **Platforms**: Omarchy and Windows  
- **Currently**:
  - Moving more of my work to **Linux** 🐧  
  - Getting more comfortable with **Node.js**

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I have **dyspraxia**.  
It means my thinking is not linear. That turns out to be useful when building systems and spotting problems early.

If you’re looking through the repos, expect working code, half-built ideas, and things that were rebuilt more than once.
