### Hello, I'm Mike.

I have a **BA in Creative Digital Media**, as a result I am equiped with a background in

## 🎨 Design and 🖥️ Development along with a whole assortment of other ancillary areas.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on a couple of side projects.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I have dyspraxia; so it's almost like my thoughts are set to shuffle.
