## Hey, I’m Mike MacDonagh – aka **Mechanical Mad Hog**

I build things where **design** meets **development**.  
Sometimes sleek. Sometimes experimental. Always meant to work.

I’m drawn to systems that are easy to understand, flexible over time, and don’t fall apart the moment real people start using them.

I’m a **Creative Digital Media**'er who enjoys turning rough ideas into things that actually function.  
At the moment, a lot of my spare time goes into **Walter**… an offline AI project I’m building to help me think, explore ideas, and stress-test systems.

Most of what I do comes down to pushing tools and workflows until the cracks show, then figuring out how to make them stronger.

### What I Like Building
- 🎨 Interfaces that look good *and* feel straightforward to use  
- 🖥️ Tools that save time by removing unnecessary steps  
- 🔧 Small, slightly odd experiments that slowly turn into solid systems  

---

### Right Now I’m
- Teaching Walter to run **without the cloud**
- Finishing my **Full-Stack Certificate**  
  (Eight certificates in total… basically a self-directed mini degree)
- Revisiting existing projects to challenge assumptions and edge cases
- Growing my portfolio with systems that are **robust, inspectable, and maintainable**

---

### 🔮 What’s Next
- Treating testing and debugging as part of the build, not a clean-up step  
- Building **Walter’s Brain**  
  Obsidian + Docker + Neo4j + local LLMs  
  An offline environment for reasoning, modelling, and system analysis  

---

### 🛠️ Tech I’m Working With
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (custom themes, animations), JavaScript (DOM, regex, small games)  
- **Frameworks**: Jekyll (static sites), CodePen (rapid demos), GitHub Pages (deployment)  
- **AI / Automation**: n8n, LM Studio, Docker, Anything-LLM  
- **Platforms**: Omarchy + Windows (dual-system workflow)  
- **New Priorities**:  
  - Moving fully to **Linux**  
  - Getting more comfortable with **Node.js**

⚡ **Fun fact**  
I have **dyspraxia**, which means my thinking tends to be non-linear…  
useful for spotting patterns, designing systems, and finding solutions that aren’t always obvious.

Have a look around. You’ll find working prototypes, hardened builds, and the occasional happy accident.
